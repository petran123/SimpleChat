# SimpleChat
A simple chat webapp to demonstrate my knowledge of C# and Angular.

It is currently on MVP stage.


Future improvements:

Clean up code structure and adhere to best practices.

Switch to websockets or server-sent requests instead of plain gets.

Add user list.

Add logic to turn users inactive after a timeout.

Message list should scroll down when there is a new message and the user is already scrolled to the bottom.
